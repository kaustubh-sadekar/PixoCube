# PixoCube
PixoCube is a digital version of photo cubes that people usually gift others. It is basically a 3D cube with different images consisting of different sides of the cube. The interesting part of this project is I used concepts of camera projection and only opencv functions to render the cube. Moreover the camera view point is rendered such that it shifts based on the movement of users face.
